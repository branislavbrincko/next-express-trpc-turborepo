# Next.js + Express + Trpc + Turborepo Example

This repository serves as an example of a monorepo setup with `pnpm` and `Turborepo` (it was bootstrapped from the official [Turborepo example](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/with-docker)).

It consists of two applications:

-   web (Next.js)
-   api (Express)

Additionally, there are shared packages for `eslint` and `typescript` configuration.

Quick start (in `root` folder):

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
